Schools and programs will start on time. We will notify families and staff in the morning if schedule changes are needed.  \n  \nTo find your snow route bus stop location:\n\n*   Login to [Skyward Family Access](https://www2.saas.wa-k12.net/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService=wlkwashs71/fwemnu01.w). \n*   Select “Busing” on the left-side menu.  Snow routes will be labeled with “Snow” under the “Days” column. \n\nPlease note: It is possible that your “Snow Route” bus stops are the same as your regular stops.  \n  \n**Morning Snow Routes:**  \nWe always encourage riders to arrive at their stop at least five minutes early to ensure they do not miss the bus, as the bus will not return to the stop after it has left."}]}
